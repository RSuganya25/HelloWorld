## Overview

**Project Title**: Hello World Program

**Project Description**:  
This is a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. It demonstrates basic syntax and serves as an introductory project for GitHub repository management.

**Project Goals**:  
- To practice creating a simple Python script.
- To set up a GitHub repository for the project.
- To learn how to push code to GitHub and maintain version control.

## Instructions for Build and Use

### Steps to build and/or run the software:
1. Clone the repository using the command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RSuganya25/HelloWorld.git
2. Navigate into the project directory:
cd HelloWorld
3. Run the Python script:
python hello_world.py

Instructions for using the software:
Make sure you have Python installed on your machine (Python 3.x recommended).
After cloning the repo and navigating to the directory, simply run the Python script with:
python hello_world.py
The script will print "Hello, World!" to the console.

### Development Environment

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:
Python 3.x or above
Git for version control
A code editor such as Visual Studio Code (optional, but recommended)
